### Project Overview
Welcome to our first project! In this task, we will be creating a webpage from a designer file available on Figma. The main focus will be on HTML structure only. No CSS or style is required at this point.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

How to Create an HTML Page from a Wireframe
Creating an HTML page from a wireframe involves interpreting the elements on the wireframe into corresponding HTML tags. This process includes identifying headers, paragraphs, links, images, forms, etc., and translating them into HTML syntax.

## What is a Markup Language?

A Markup Language is a computer-based language that is used to format and organize documents. It utilizes tags or codes to define the structure, layout, and appearance of content within the document. These tags are enclosed within angle brackets and are typically written in plain text. They are used to indicate how different parts of the document should be displayed and interpreted by software and browsers. Markup languages are commonly used in the development of websites, as they allow developers to specify how text, images, tables, links, and other elements should be displayed. 

The most well-known and widely used markup language is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard language for creating web pages. Other examples of markup languages include XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is used for representing structured data, and Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting and structuring text documents. In summary, a markup language is a vital tool in web development and document formatting, allowing for the organization and presentation of content in a standardized and structured manner.
In a document, a markup language is a method of distinguishing text using annotations. It defines elements by using tags. An example of a markup language is HTML, which utilizes tags to describe web pages.



## What is the DOM?

The DOM, otherwise known as the Document Object Model, is a crucial component of web development. It represents the structure of an HTML document and allows for dynamic manipulation and interaction with the content. The DOM is organized in a tree-like structure, with each element as a node. It provides a way to access and modify the elements and properties of a webpage using JavaScript, making it an essential tool for creating responsive and interactive web applications. Without it, we would not be able to manipulate elements, add event listeners, or update content dynamically. In summary, the DOM is what gives life to a static HTML document, allowing developers to create dynamic and engaging web experiences.

As a programming interface for web documents, the Document Object Model (DOM) allows developers to manipulate a web page's content and visual presentation by representing the page's structure as a tree-like object.



## What is an Attribute?

In HTML, elements have attributes that provide extra information. These attributes are found in the opening tag and typically consist of pairs of names and values. For example, the attribute name in "<img src="picture.jpg">" is src, and its value is "picture.jpg".
